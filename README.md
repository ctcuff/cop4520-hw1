# Primes

## The Problem
Your non-technical manager assigns you the task to find all primes between 1 and 10^8.  The assumption is that your company is going to use a parallel machine that supports eight concurrent threads. Thus, in your design you should plan to spawn 8 threads that will perform the necessary computation. Your boss does not have a strong technical background but she is a reasonable person. Therefore, she expects to see that the work is distributed such that the computational execution time is approximately equivalent among the threads.

### Required Output
Please print the following output to a file named primes.txt:

```
<execution time>  <total number of primes found>  <sum of all primes found>
<top ten maximum primes, listed in order from lowest to highest>
```

## Running the Code
Assuming you're running on a unix-like system, you'll need to have [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) installed as well as C++17:

- In the root directory, run `make run` to run the code. This compiles everything into a directory named `out` then runs that executable.
- You can also run `make clean` to remove files in the `out` directory generated by `make`
